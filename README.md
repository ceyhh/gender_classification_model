# Simple basic gender classification machine learning script

## I used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

## It only works with face 

## I mean only face

## Does not guarantees %100 accuracy (maybe 80%) 

## Proper lightning and straigt face angle is recommended for detection

## in order to use script just change the location of your image in load model 

## I already trained with 3 epochs and 16 batch size but you can use your own settings to train it

## The first element of output matrix is Probability of woman gender and the second one is Probability of man gender (yes i just copy pasted Probability from internet i just forgot how to pronounce)
