# Simple basic gender classification machine learning script

# I used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

# It only works with face 

# I mean only face

# Does not guarantees %100 accuracy (maybe 80%) 

# Proper lightning and straigt face angle is recommended for detection

# For using just change the location of your image in load model 

## I already trained with 3 epochs and 16 batch size but you can use your own settings to train it
